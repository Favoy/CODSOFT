Sales Prediction using Linear Regression

- PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project predicts analyse the relationship between 'TV advertising' and 'sales' using a simple linear regression model.


- DATASET
The dataset used is the advertising dataset from Kaggle, which includes:
- Source: `advertising.csv`
- Features:
  - TV
  - Radio
  - Newspaper
  - Sales (Target)


- Steps Performed

1. Loaded and explored the dataset
2. Visualized correlation between features
3. Performed train-test split (80/20)
4. Trained a Linear Regression model
5. Evaluated performance using:
   - RMSE
   - R² Score
6. Visualized Actual vs Predicted Sales
7. Visualized TV Advertising vs Sales with Regression Line
8. Visualized Residuals
9. Saved the final model using joblib


- Results

- RMSE: 2.47
- R² Score: 0.803


- Tools

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
